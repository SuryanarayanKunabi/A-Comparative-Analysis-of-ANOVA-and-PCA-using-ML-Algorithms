This project aims to detect credit card fraud using machine learning algorithms.It focuses on comparing two popular feature selection and extraction methods: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The effectiveness of these methods is evaluated using various machine learning models to determine which provides better accuracy and performance in detecting fraudulent transactions.
